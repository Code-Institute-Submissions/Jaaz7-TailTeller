## Dataset Content
  - ### The dataset is a [competition challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification) from Kaggle.<br>
      Its contents include:<br><br>
      - A training directory with 10,222 pictures of dogs:
      - a labels.csv metadata.<br><br>
    The training directory was split into a training and testing directories, both with 5,111 images.<br>
    The metadata has 2 columns. A column 'id' corresponding to the image files in the training directory and 'breed' corresponding to the      label of the dog breed. There are 120 unique breeds.<br>
    This dataset aids in training the machine learning model to accurately identify and differentiate between breeds.

---
## Business Requirements
  1. The client would like to have a study of the dataset collected.
  2. The client requires a machine learning model developed to accurately identify dog breeds from images.
     
  The project aims to assist people like veterinarians, breeders, groomers and dog enthusiasts by providing:

  - Accuracy: High accuracy in predicting dog breeds to aid in better breed-specific care.
  - Interpretation: Clear explanations of prediction results, helping users interpret the data.
  - Speed: Exhaustive optimization for minimal CPU and RAM usage impact to offer results as fast as possible..
  - Privacy: Ensuring that all user data is handled with strict confidentiality and security measures.

## Hypothesis

### Problem Statement
This project develops a machine learning model to accurately identify the breed of a dog from its image. This is challenging due to the fine-grained variations and similarities across different dog breeds.

### Expected Model Behavior
The model is expected to make deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to capture complex features of dog breeds from images. The hypothesis is that using an ensemble of pre-trained models like Inception V3, Xception, NASNetLarge, and InceptionResNet V2, it will allow for a rich feature extraction and breed classification.

### Assumptions
- The dataset contains high-quality images of 120 dog breeds.
- The breeds are represented with different sample numbers so it's possible more breeds will have higher accuracy than others, however an overall high accuracy is expected.

### Basis of Hypothesis
Based on prior successes with CNNs in image recognition tasks and their ability to learn hierarchical feature representations, these models are well-suited for detailed and nuanced image-based classification tasks like dog breed identification.

### Implications of Hypothesis Validation
Validation of this hypothesis would confirm the suitability of using multi-model CNN ensembles for breed classification. If the hypothesis is validated, it would lead to further development and potentially real-world application of the model. If invalidated, it would necessitate a reevaluation of the model architecture or training process.

---
## Business Case
  ### Project Overview:
  - The client aims to accurately identify the breed of a dog from a given image. This business goal will be achieved through the       
  development and deployment of a TensorFlow-based deep learning pipeline. The pipeline will utilize a dataset of images classified by 
  dog breeds.

  ### Technical Approach:
  - The deep learning pipeline will utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN), a model highly effective at recognizing patterns in image 
  data.

  ### Objective:
  - The primary objective of this machine learning pipeline is to create a multi-class classification model. The desired outcome is a model 
  that can successfully categorize dog breeds.

  ### Model Output:
  - The model will output a classification label that indicates the breed of the dog, based on the probabilities calculated by the model.

  ### Application of Results:
  The images might be used by veterinary health care, training or grooming.

  ### Performance Metrics:
  - The success of this model will be evaluated based on overall accuracy and the F1 score for each breed. Given the varying sample sizes 
  per breed, particular attention will be paid to minimize the risk of misclassification.

  ### Accuracy and Reliability:
  - The client sets a high bar for accuracy given the potential for the model to influence decisions about dog care and management.
  Initial targets  might aim for an F1 score of above 0.90, accuracy and reliability are key.

## Model Development

  ### Technical Setup
  Models used in this Pipeline process:
  
  1. Inception V3: Known for its efficiency and ability to detect features.
  2. Xception: Utilizes convolutions to provide a more efficient modeling.
  3. NASNetLarge: Offers a scalable architecture for image recognition.
  4. InceptionResNet V2: Combines the connections for faster training.<br>
     These models are put together in one to ensuring robust breed classification.

  ### Image Preprocessing
  - To standardize inputs and enhance model performance, images are resized to 299x299 pixels with three color channels (RGB). This 
  resizing matches the input requirements of the models (as seen in Keras documentation), this helps with consistency.

  ### Feature Extraction and Classification
  - Each model processes the input images to extract vital features, which are then concatenated to form a comprehensive and rich feature 
  set.

  ### Feature Concatenation:
  - Combines outputs from multiple pre-trained models to create a robust representation of the images.
  - Classification: A final set of dense layers interprets these features to classify the image into one of the dog breeds. This is 
  achieved using a softmax layer, which outputs a probability distribution over the breed classes.
  This multi-model approach improves the accuracy of classification, and enhances the model's ability to identify unseen data reducing overfitting and improving predictions.

## Issues
  - My biggest challenge this project was managing large files with github and heroku, heroku has a limit slug size of 500mb but my build     was over this amount even though my repo was 18mb at the time, I was using .gitignore and .slugignore to skip/hide any big files, 
    images folders included. I decided to use Docker and leave heroku deployments because it took a large amount of my time, I found out 
    online this is a very common occurence with data scientists. Docker fixed all that for me.
