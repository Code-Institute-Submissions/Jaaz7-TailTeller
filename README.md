# Dog Breed Identifier
**A Data Science and Machine Learning project developed as part of a specialized pathway in Predictive Analytics.<br>
It utilizes Artificial Intelligence and its primary goal is to tell the dog breed based on image data.<br>
This application is developed using a [Streamlit Dashboard](https://tailteller-f41359586dd2.herokuapp.com/), providing users (such as veterinarians, dog breeders and groomers) with the capability to upload images of dogs and receive instant predictions regarding their breed.**

## Dataset Content
  - ### The dataset is a [competition challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification) from Kaggle.<br>
      Its contents include:<br><br>
      - A training directory with 10,222 pictures of dogs:
      - a labels.csv metadata.<br><br>
    The training directory was split into a training and testing directories, both with 5,111 images.<br>
    The metadata has 2 columns. A column 'id' corresponding to the image files in the training directory and 'breed' corresponding to the      label of the dog breed. There are 120 unique breeds.<br>
    This dataset aids in training the machine learning model to accurately identify and differentiate between breeds.

## Business Requirements
  1. The client would like to have a study of the dataset collected.
  2. The client requires a machine learning model developed to accurately identify dog breeds from images.
     
  The project aims to assist people like veterinarians, breeders, groomers and dog enthusiasts by providing:

  - Accuracy: High accuracy in predicting dog breeds to aid in better breed-specific care.
  - Interpretation: Clear explanations of prediction results, helping users interpret the data.
  - Speed: Exhaustive optimization for minimal CPU and RAM usage impact to offer results as fast as possible..
  - Privacy: Ensuring that all user data is handled with strict confidentiality and security measures.

## Hypothesis
Initial hypotheses posit that machine learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can effectively distinguish between dog breeds from images. Validation of these hypotheses will be conducted through:

Detailed analysis and performance metrics of the model.
Continuous testing to ensure model accuracy and reliability.

---
## ML Model Development
  - Multiple versions of our machine learning model have been developed, each iteratively improved based on testing feedback and       
    performance metrics. The final model employs advanced deep learning techniques to ensure robust breed classification.
